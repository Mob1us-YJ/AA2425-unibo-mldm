# Case Study: Smart Irrigation

# Data Platforms in the Agritech Domain

The synergy of internet of things (IoT) and precision farming is producing valuable applications in the Agritech domain [@vitali2021crop]

- **Agritech**: use of technology for farming to improve efficiency and profitability

Optimizing soil moisture is crucial for watering and crop performance [@turkeltaub2016real]

- **GOAL**: saving water while improving fruit quality (i.e., provide a recommendation of the amount necessary water)
- *Soils* have different water retention
- *Watering systems* have different behaviors (e.g., drippers and sprinklers)
- *Plants* have different water demand (e.g., Kiwi [@judd1986water] vs Grapes)
- *Sensors* produce different measurements with different precisions

# Reference Scenario

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

We consider an orchard where 

- Kiwi *plants are aligned along rows*
- Each row has many *drippers* (e.g., 1 every 60cm)
- Drippers can water a *limited soil volume*

# Digital Transformation

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

(Example) Scenarios of digital transformation in agriculture

- Scenario #1
    - The farmer/technician controls the watering system based only on the experience
    - No digital data/KPIs/automation
- Scenario #2
    - The control of the watering system is refined by observing sensor data
    - Sensor data is digitalized, no KPIs/automatic
- Scenario #3
    a decision support system that, knowing how to optimize KPIs, controls the watering system

# Simulators...

To achieve our goal, it necessary to understand of the soil behaves

Simulate the soil behavior according to physical models [@van1980closed]

- However a fine tuning is required, we need to know/parametrize everything
    - Soil (e.g., retention curve, hysteresis [@pham2005study])
    - Plant (e.g., roots, LAI)
    - Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, precipitations)
    - Watering system (e.g., capacity, distance between drippers)
- Tuning can take months (of human interactions)!
    - Need to collect samples from the fieldâ€¦ if some parameter is incorrect we need to trace back
    - Need to implement/code all these features into the simulator [@vsimunek2012hydrus] [@bittelli2015soil]
    - Hyper-parameter tuning with machine learning can help, but it is not a silver bullet

![Symmetry Assumptions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00856965-4270-4d73-92b6-407cf536bfb3)

:::
::::

- If watered volume is symmetric along the row, a 2D sensor grid is sufficient to represent the soil volume
- If moisture variations take place along the row too, a 3D grid of sensors is required
    - E.g., too sparse drippers

1. Soil moisture is a continuum in the soil
1. Sensors return a discretized representation of soil moisture
    - Depending on the number of sensors and on their layout the monitoring accuracy changes
1. Goal: produce fine-grained soil profiles out of coarse-grained layouts
