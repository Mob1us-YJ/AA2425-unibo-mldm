# Hi!

Matteo Francia, Ph.D.

- Email: m.francia@unibo.it
- Assistant Professor (junior) @ DISI, UniBO
- www: [https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/m.francia/en](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/m.francia/en)

Teaching

- [DTM] Big Data and Cloud Platforms (Module 2)
- [DTM] Machine Learning and Data Mining (Module 2)

Research topics

- Big data / database / machine learning
- Precision agriculture and spatio-temporal analytics

[BIG (Business Intelligence Group)](https://big.csr.unibo.it/)

- w/ Prof. Golfarelli, Prof. Gallinucci

# Table of Contents and Course Goals

Hands-on *machine learning* (module 2, 24 hours)

- Theory, practice, and case studies of the main steps of the CRISP-DM methodology
  - (Tentative) Labs will be every two weeks
  - Python libraries for machine learning (mainly `pandas` and `scikit-learn`)

*Learning the working knowledge for the Artificial Intelligence field*

- You must know the right terms and paradigms behind AI
- You must know what AI is and how it works

Goals

- *Develop your own (simple) project* based on AI
- *Make technical considerations* about AI
- *Understanding the surrounding AI world*
  - Orient yourself in an extremely dynamic and complex world dominated by AI
  - Make decisions with AI
  - Try to make predictions about AI for your company

# (Oral) Exam

Questions on **all (theoretical and practical) aspects** of the course

- **Be prepared**: you have to wait 1 month before trying again (in any case)
- Two separate and independent exam sessions (the other w/ Prof. Golfarelli)
  - The final mark is the average of the two exams
- **Interaction** during the lectures/labs is considered in the final evaluation

No scheduled dates, just **book when you are ready**

- At least one week in advance
- Use the [Booking](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/DTMMachineLearningModule@live.unibo.it/bookings/s/VXKOGV3sS02dofzMZtOpHQ2) page

According to the University's regulation

- Exams must be in presence
- Cannot refuse a grade more than once

On the day of the exam (~30 minutes per person):

- 3 questions on different topics about the whole program
- (Optional) Presentation & discussion with slides about a final assignment (10/15 minutes)
The final mark of the exam will be averaged with the Data Mining module

# Assignment (Machine Learning)

Either on Machine Learning (ask me) or Data Mining (ask Prof. Golfarelli)

Develop an AI system in a group of 2 people (at maximum)

1. Define the problem (of your interest!), the core of your project
1. Define your strategy (algorithms), find data (datasets), ...
1. Compare your strategy with existing ones (check on Google Scholar) ...
1. Describe the insights you extracted from your analysis

**You are responsible for your code** ("I do not know how to program" is not a valid excuse!)

- **If you cannot explain your code and your choices**...
- ... **and/or you copied and pasted it from colleagues or LLMs**
- ... you will retake the exam

Once defined your project:

1. Send me an email to discuss the details of your project
1. After my approval, register the group (2 people at maximum) and project here: [https://forms.gle/T1hynSuu6LpRGtjw8](https://forms.gle/T1hynSuu6LpRGtjw8)
1. Now you can start your project on Google Colab

# Presenting the Assignment

Once the project is completed

- Write a 6-page paper about the project
  - Use Latex ([https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/))
  - Use this template ([https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/assets/zip/ieeetran-final_sub.zip](https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/assets/zip/ieeetran-final_sub.zip))
  - Sections:
    1. Introduction (~1 page; including group organization and the work done by each member)
    2. Related Work (~1 page; what others have done or which techniques can be applied)
    3. Proposed Method (~2.5 pages; what did you do and how)
    4. Results (~1 page; results and insights)
    5. Conclusions (~0.5 pages; summary)
- Upload the paper, assignment, and presentation into a Github repo
  - The assignment must be executable on Google Colab without errors
- Share (with me) the Github repo

**When both members have studied and all the material is ready, both members must book the exam on the same day**


# Teaching material

You will find all you need on Virtuale

- Slides
- and Python notebooks to be opened on Google Colab

However, **keeping up the pace with machine learning and data mining is hard**

- There is a rapid development of trends and technologies, and not all of them will survive
- Books are easily outdated with respect to cutting-edge services and technologies
- Research papers (often) describe solutions that are not commercial yet
- (IRL) You will need to deal with a lot of (bad) documentation, online articles, etc.

Rule of thumb

- Understand the general concepts and fundamentals
- Connect the dots... and ask questions!

# Books

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Slides and notes are sufficient to prepare for the final exam

- You can find them on Virtuale platform ([https://virtuale.unibo.it/](https://virtuale.unibo.it/))

However, I suggest you to read the book:

- *Title*: Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow
- *Author*: Aurélien Géron
- Some notes about the book:
  - The book is intended as a support
  - The book is available for free in the library
  - The book is pretty huge (about 800 pages)
  - Carefully check the summary and select our topics
  - If you want, you can read the other parts to take inspiration (not requested for the final exam)
