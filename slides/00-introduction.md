# Hi!

Matteo Francia, Ph.D.

- Email: m.francia@unibo.it
- Assistant Professor (junior) @ DISI, UniBO
- www: [https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/m.francia/en]

Research topics

- Big data / database / machine learning
- Precision agriculture and spatio-temporal analytics

BIG (Business Intelligence Group)

- [https://big.csr.unibo.it/]

# Table of Contents and Course Goals

Hands-on machine learning

- Introduction to the CRISP-DM methodology
- Theory and practice of the main steps of machine learning pipelines
    - Labs will be every two weeks
    - Python libraries for machine learning (mainly Pandas and sk-learn)

Learning the working knowledge for the Artificial Intelligence field

- You must know the right terms and paradigms behind AI
- You must know what AI is and how it works

Developing your own AI system

- You will be able to develop your (simple) own project based on AI
- You will be able to make technical considerations about AI
- Understanding the surrounding AI world in order to:

Orient yourself in an extremely dinamic and complex world dominated by AI

- Make decisions with AI
- Try to make predictions about AI for your company

# Exam

Questions on all (theoretical and practical) aspects of the course

- Be prepared: you have to wait 1 month before trying again (in any case)
- Two separate and independent exam sessions (the other w/ Prof. Golfarelli)
    - The final mark is the average of the two exams
- Lab contents are included in the evaluation
- Interaction during the lectures/labs is considered in the final evaluation

No scheduled dates, just come when you are ready

- At least one week in advance

According to the University's regulation

- Exams must be in presence
- Cannot refuse a grade more than once

# Assignment

Assignment (more information will come at the end of the lectures):

- Either on Machine Learning (ask me) or Data Mining (ask Prof. Golfarelli)
- You are responsible for your code
    - If you cannot explain your code and your choices...
    - ... and/or you copied and pasted it from colleagues or LLMs
    - ... you will need to retake the exam
    - "I do not know how to program" is not a valid excuse!

Each group must develop an AI system

- Define the problem (of your interest!), the core of your project
- Define your strategy (algorithms), find data (datasets), ...
- Compare your strategy with already existing ones (if possibile) → Google, Google Scholar, ...
- Describe the insights you extracted from your analysis

Once defined your project:

- Send me an email to discuss the details of your project
- After my approval, register the group (2 people at maximum) and project here: https://forms.gle/T1hynSuu6LpRGtjw8
- Now you can start your project!
  - With Colab, the code must be executable and without errors

--- 

Once the project is completed AND both members are ready (have studied), the group leader has to:

- Contact me and define an appointment for the exam
- Send the project code (e.g. the link of the Github repo)
- Send a 6 pages paper about the project:
  - Use Latex (https://www.overleaf.com/)
  - Use this template (https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/assets/zip/ieeetran-final_sub.zip)
  - Tentative sections: 1. Introduction, 2. Related Work, 3. Proposed Method, 4. Results, 5. Conclusions + a section of
peer-review about group organization and the work done by each member

---

At the day of the exam:

- Presentation with slides about the project (10/15 minutes)
- Discussion about the paper
- Oral questions about the whole program
- Final mark of the exam will be averaged with the Data Mining module

# Teaching material

You will find all you need on Virtuale

- Slides
- and Python notebooks to be opened on Google Colab

However, keeping up the pace with machine learning and data mining is hard

- There is a rapid development of trends and technologies, and not all of them will survive
- Books are easily outdated with respect to cutting-edge services and technologies
- Research papers (often) describe solutions that are not commercial yet
- (IRL) You will need to deal with a lot of (bad) documentation, online articles, etc.

Rule of thumb

- Understand the general concepts and fundamentals
- Connect the dots... and ask questions!

# Books

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Slides and notes are sufficient to prepare the final exam

- You can find them on Virtuale platform (https://virtuale.unibo.it/)

However, I suggest you to read the book:

- Title: Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow
- Author: Aurélien Géron
- Some notes about the book:
  - The book is intended as a support
  - The book is available for free in the «Leon Battista Alberti» library
  - The book is pretty huge (about 800 pages)
  - Carefully check the summary and select our topics
  - If you want, you can read the other parts to take inspiration (not requested for the final exam)
