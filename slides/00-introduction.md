# Hi!

Matteo Francia, Ph.D.

- Email: m.francia@unibo.it
- Assistant Professor (junior) @ DISI, UniBO
- www: [https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/m.francia/en]

Research topics

- Big data / database / machine learning
- Precision agriculture and spatio-temporal analytics

BIG (Business Intelligence Group)

# Table of Contents and Exam

Hands-on machine learning

- Introduction to the CRISP-DM methodology
- Theory and practice of the main steps of machine learning pipelines
    - Labs will be every two weeks
    - Python libraries for machine learning (mainly Pandas and sk-learn)

All these points will be part of the oral examination! :)

- Be prepared: you have to wait 1 month before trying again (in any case)

# Table of Contents and Exam

Questions on all (theoretical and practical) aspects of the course

- Two separate and independent exam sessions (the other w/ Prof. Golfarelli)
    - The final mark is the average of the two exams
- Lab contents are included in the evaluation
- Interaction during the lectures/labs is considered in the final evaluation

Assignment (more information will come at the end of the lectures):

- Either on Machine Learning (ask me) or Data Mining (ask Prof. Golfarelli)
- You are responsible for your code
    - If you cannot explain your code and your choices...
    - ... and/or you copied and pasted it from colleagues or LLMs
    - ... you will need to retake the exam
    - "I do not know how to program" is not a valid excuse!

No scheduled dates, just come when you are ready

- At least one week in advance

According to the University's regulation

- Exams must be in presence
- Cannot refuse a grade more than once

# Teaching material

You will find all you need in these slides

However, keeping up the pace with machine learning and data mining is hard

- There is a rapid development of trends and technologies, and not all of them will survive
- Books are easily outdated with respect to cutting-edge services and technologies
- Research papers (often) describe solutions that are not commercial yet
- (IRL) You will need to deal with a lot of (bad) documentation, online articles, etc.

Rule of thumb

- Understand the general concepts and fundamentals
- Connect the dots... and ask questions!
