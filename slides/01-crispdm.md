Put simply, CRISP-DM is a comprehensive data mining methodology and process model that provides anyone—from novices to data mining experts—with a complete blueprint for conducting a data mining project.

CRISP-DM breaks down the life cycle of a data mining project into six phases:

1. business understanding,
1. data understanding,
1. data preparation,
1. modeling,
1. evaluation,
1. and deployment.

The arrows indicate the most important and frequent dependencies between the phases, while the outer circle symbolizes the cyclical nature of data mining itself and illustrates that the lessons learned during the data mining process and from the deployed solution can trigger new, often more focused business questions.

# Business understanding

(Perhaps the most important phase of any data mining project)

The initial business understanding phase focuses on

- understanding the project objectives from a business perspective,
- converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition,
- and then developing a preliminary plan designed to achieve the objectives.

In order to understand which data should later be analyzed, and how, it is vital for data mining practitioners to fully understand the business for which they are finding a solution. The business understanding phase involves several key steps, including determining business objectives, assessing the situation, determining the data mining goals, and producing the project plan.
